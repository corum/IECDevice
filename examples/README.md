# Examples

These examples demonstrate how to implement devices using the IECDevice library:
  - [IECBasicSerial](IECBasicSerial) demonstrates how to use the IECDevice class to implement a very simple IEC-Bus-to-serial converter.
  - [IECBasicSD](IECBasicSD) demonstrates how to use the IECFileDevice class to implement a very simple SD card reader.
  - [IECCentronics](IECCentronics) is an adapter to connect Centronics printers to via the IEC bus.
  - [IECSD](IECSD) is an SD card reader.
  - [IECFDC](IECFDC)/[IECFDCMega](IECFDCMega) combine the IECDevice library with my [ArduinoFDC library](https://github.com/dhansel/ArduinoFDC) to connect PC floppy disk drives (3.5" or 5") to the IEC bus.
