# Build instructions

To build an IECCentronics device, start by uploading the [Gerber](gerber.zip) file
to a PCB manufacturing company. A [BOM](bom.csv) listing all needed parts including
manufacturer and DigiKey part numbers is also available. When soldering, you can refer 
to the [PCB layout](pcb.pdf) and [schematic](schematic.pdf) files. 

Here is a picture of a completed PCB (note: there have been some changes to the PCB
since I took this picture):

There are also STL files for 3d-printing a case ([top](CaseTop.stl), [bottom](CaseBottom.stl)):
